## Hi there 👋

Model Atlas of the Earth (M@TE) is a project supported by AuScope, supporting FAIR data practicies in relation to computational models of the Earth. In line with our funding, the scope of the M@TE is promariliy models of the rocky earth: tectonics/geodynamics, hydrogeology and surface processes. 

M@TE consists of: 

* The M@TE model collection, hosted on the [National Computational Infrastructure](geonetwork.nci.org.au)
* digital infrastructure to support the generation of rich metadata (e.g. github.com/ModelAtlasofTheEarth)
* The [M@TE website](http://mate.science), exposing computational models to a broad audience
