## Hi there 👋

The Model Atlas of the Earth (M@TE) is a project funded by AuScope, dedicated to fostering FAIR data practices for computational models of the Earth's structure and processes. M@TE primarily addresses models related to the study of the rocky Earth, including: tectonics and geodynamics, geothermal systems, surface processes, hydrogeology, geotechnical engineering, and reservoir-scale simulation.

M@TE consists of: 

* The M@TE model collection, hosted on the [National Computational Infrastructure](geonetwork.nci.org.au)
* digital infrastructure to support the generation of rich metadata (e.g. github.com/ModelAtlasofTheEarth)
* The [M@TE website](http://mate.science), exposing computational models to a broad audience
